# Pong, made with SDL2 and C++

This is a simple Pong game made using SDL2 and C++, meant to be played by 1 player against an enemy AI opponent.

In order to run this, you will need to install [SDL2](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases) and [SDL2_ttf](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_ttf)
If you run into any issues, the specific versions I used are down below:
- SDL2 version 2.30.11
- SDL2_ttf version 2.24.0
